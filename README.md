This game requires you to have VLC player installed, https://www.videolan.org/. This is a standard audio/video player.

For judging please only do a few songs, the API is limited by google.

Run pip install google-api-python-client pygame yt-dlp python-vlc spotipy if your missing dependencies, if your still missing some after this it should list what you need from there.

For this to run you need to add your Youtube Data APIv3 key to youtube.py. You also need to add your Spotify client Id and spotify client secret to game.py in the @dataclass.

Have fun!
